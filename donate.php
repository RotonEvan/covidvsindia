      <h1>Donate Food</h1>
      <p>As the privileged section of the society panicked and hoarded up for their
        Netflix and chill sessions at home during the lockdown, many remained blithely
        oblivious to the fact that thanks to their hoarding, food prices are skyrocketing.
        Which means most informal sector workers, who do not have any job right now
        and are perhaps stuck in a city where they are migrant labourers and therefore
        have no home, will soon not have the money to feed themselves the bare
        minimum required to stay alive.<br><br>
        State governments of Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, Kerala
        and a few others have announced special packages and relief funds for such
        individuals. However, state and central government efforts alone will not be
        enough. Therefore, it is important, for citizens, civic bodies, Non-Governmental
        Organisations (NGOs) as well as industry leaders, to come together to help
        the marginalised section.
